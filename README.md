========

tipi4icy is a collection of [Icy](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) plugins based on
[TiPi](https://github.com/emmt/TiPi), a Java *Toolkit for Inverse Problems and Imaging*.

Plugins
========

**MitivDeconvolution**

MitivDeconvolution is the plugin that use linear algorithms to deconvolve 2D or 3D images.

The algorithms are wiener and linear conjugate gradients.

In ICY this plugin is available as a protocol.

**MitivTotalVariation**

MitivTotalVartion use the Total variation (non linear) to deconvolve 2D or 3D images.

In ICY this plugin is available as a protocol.

**MitivGlobalDeconv**

MitivGlobalDeconv (temporary name) is the plugin that is able to do blind deconvolution for microscopy images.

In progress...
